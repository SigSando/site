###### In progress ***December 30, 2025***
Beyond being familiar with how networks are used, there is a lot of history and development behind networks.

# Common Network infrastructure devices

## ISP modem:
ISP modems are not as common anymore, but usually work in tandem with a physical router to allows access to the WorldWideWeb/Internet via DSL (which is similar to telephone lines) as well as Cable internet. There is also fiber internet to be aware of. in terms of speed and cost, usually it goes, AIR/SIM, DSL, Cable, Fiber internet lines. As of writing this.

## Router:
Routes and distributes internet connections to devices from the Modem, then creates a local network (Wi-fi) when a router is connected. HUGE note, Routers will route all inter-device traffic as well. This is how LAN parties work. LAN is served and now your laptop can talk to your fridge and washing machine.

## Access point:
Extends a local network wirelessly. But also not wirelessly. Usually these are strategically placed around offices, warehouses, homes etc. They emit a signal that is a replication of the original network.

## Switch
Extends the amount of wired connections that a router can use basically. Switches come in brands because they are so important (such as all other devices) such as Cisco Switches, ubiquiti fortinet etc.

## Endpoint
A device on the network

# Common Network infrastructure Physicalities

## DeMarc/MPOE
The Demarcation point or minimum point of entry. Not as often used unless in highly regulated environments.

## MDF
Main point of connectivity (Main Distribution Frame)
Hopefully up to date and rolling changes and security updates downwards.

## IDF
Secondary point of connectivity (Intermediate Distribution Frame)
From my experience these ones are a mess.

## IPF
not as oftenly used, but can relate to Information Processing Facilities. On a much larger scale this would be the infrastructure that host information proccessing servers. Could be totally wrong Not sure.


## Firewalls

- a Firewall allows or denies traffic based on the rules that are set up. Common fields will include; Name, Description, Interface, Allow/Deny, Source IP/group, Destination IP/Group, Ports, and block all, whitelists, blacklists.
please see the other page for Firewalls for more info.

## Guest Network
- a Guest Network will be a seperate network that is only for visitors. 

## VLAN
- a `VLAN` stands for Virtual Local Area Network. This is a logical segmentation configured on a network switch. This is commonly used for seperating different areas of business such as IT and HR for a company or different departments like a surgical ward and medical offices in a hospital


## DMZ & why are they important

- Usually a DMZ will face outwards, protecting the business enviroment and internal LANs. 

- Firewalls are a major part of network security, any application or user will have to be compliant to the firewall in order to reach outbound to the World Wide Web/Internet.


## NGFW(Next Gen Firewalls) 
Provide the ability for stateful inspection, DPI, CSW or closer server monitoring, while providing a lot of features basically. It's more of a sales term to describe the current meta for firewalls. 

# Networking Security Concepts

## Network Intrusion Detection
 
Network intrusion detection systems, also known as NIDS, can come in the form of software or physical devices that tap monitor network traffic in order to generate alerts for human analysts to investigate (hence the name network intrusion "detection" system). NIDS can be positioned in the following positions:
Inline - The system running the NIDS software is sitting directly in the path of network traffic, meaning all traffic will pass through the NIDS. In this case, the system will actually by definition become a Network Intrusion Prevention system, as it is able to perform defensive measures such as blocking or resetting connections.
Network Tap - The NIDS will be connected to the network by tapping into a physical connection, such as a cable.
Passive - The NIDS is connected to a SPAN port on a network device. This physical port allows all traffic passing through the device to be mirrored to the SPAN port, so the NIDS will get a copy of all network activity.
The purpose of NIDS is purely to generate alerts so that human analysts can investigate and take action if needed. If an attack is happening, the NIDS will generate an alert, and it will eventually be investigated.

## Network Intrusion Prevention
 
Whilst similar to NIDS, network intrusion prevention systems, or NIPS, are able to automatically take defensive actions based on the activity that has been identified (hence the name network intrusion "prevention" system). So a NIDS can detect activity and generate an alert, but NIPS can detect activity and take actions to defend against it. As an example, if an internal system begins scanning other systems, which would be classed as unusual activity in most networks, we can pre-program the NIPS to block any communications that originate from the suspicious system, and generate an alert so human analysts can investigate further.

## Network Log Monitoring

Network devices can generate logs, and these logs can be sent to a SIEM platform. By having logs come from systems across the environment, the SIEM is able to provide a dashboard that analysts can utilize to monitor activity and respond to alerts that are generated when suspicious or malicious traffic is detected. Network devices can provide very valuable information, let's take a look at a couple of examples:
Web Proxy Logs - This device processes web-based requests to the internet, and will contain a list of sites visited by employees. This can be combined with a blacklist to generate SIEM alerts when an employee tries to visit a malicious website or explicit website.
Perimeter Firewalls - If a malicious actor starts port scanning the organization, the perimeter firewalls will pick this activity up first as they get smashed with requests from the scanning IP(s). By sending this to a SIEM an alert can be generated when a port or vulnerability scanning is being conducted, or when distributed denial-of-service attacks (DDoS) start.

## Network Access Control
 
Network Access Control (NAC) can work to prevent rogue or non-compliant devices from connecting to a private network. Security teams could require that any devices connecting to the network need the latest patches and security updates, and must be running anti-virus. NAC is able to enforce this, and not let devices connect to the network until they have met all of the requirements. This is typically used for Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) or guest networks, where non-corporate devices will be connecting such as employee mobile phones and personal laptops, which may potentially be infected as they aren't protected by company security tools.
Ever been to a restaurant or shopping center that offers free wifi, but you need to sign up? That's NAC in action, allowing the network administrators to restrict access and manage sessions, such as networks that have time limits, like public transport and commercial flights.
