##  <span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">Why is a Network imporant??</span>
- A network is something to consider about when you join any type of Wi-Fi or school/library computer. In the digital world we live in today, a network can be defined by one or more devices connected to the same group of devices that share an internet connection. Its important to know sharing a connection is a lot more significant than the words: "free internet" or "Free Wi-Fi".

- Most importantly Networks may allow sharing of much more than you anticpate.
- Secondly there are likely to be policies or lack OF policies that you should be aware of.



##  <span style="color: royalblue; font-weight: bold;">What is a "Network" really?</span>


- A `network` is a group of interconnected devices (all on the same Wi-Fi network or Networks (can be multiple lines)) that can exchange data and resources together. Most notably, they share an internet connection. A simple home network with common household items such as **smartphones**, **laptops**, **printers**, **smart devices**, **TV's** and **other devices** on a home wifi is considered a network.

- Also, A workplace has many networks. They may have a network that only deals with providing PXE boot images for wiping old reusable laptops, new laptops and PCs.


- They can also have separate networks for allowing remote access over a VPN
- Often workplaces provide different profiles for VPN access. this could be for temporary use, regular office workplace 


## Firewalls

- a Firewall allows or denies traffic based on the rules that are set up. Common fields will include; Name, Description, Interface, Allow/Deny, Source IP/group, Destination IP/Group, Ports, and block all, whitelists, blacklists.


- Many types of firewalls are implemented. Here is a short list of some examples:
- a WAF (web application firewall), protects web-based applications
- a Cloud Firewall, protects data transfer in cloud enviroments
- multiple firewalls can be used in conjunction to more efficently route data, as well as having a layered network management. 

- what do Firewall rules look like? 
-Typically, firewall rules are very complicated. They require prior knowledge of the existing firewall rules. 


PowerShell Ex:
> FirewallRule1 -DisplayName "Allow HTTPS" - Direction Inbound  -Protocol -TCP -LocalPort 80 -Action Allow
> FirewallRule2 -DisplayName "Block All others" - Direction Any
-Protocol -Any -LocalPort Any -Action Block


### Why is seperating devices so important? 

- Not all devices should have the ability to reach a `Domain Controller` or a `Medical Device` or a `Manufacturing Sensor`.

- Often it does not make sense to allow devices to talk back and forth with every other device around it, often is it the case that it will technically create a larger and larger network until it is too big to manage. in other words it creates a larger attack surface or widens the network too much.

- Not all access points can reach the same infrastructure as other APs, so it is impossible to have a large area or WAN on the same network. Although most of the time they share the same necessary infrastructure to provide internet access. 

- When we look at at the reason for a subnet, partially it is to divide a network into smaller, more efficient networks.

- Another reason could be to seperate physical areas and regions such as a engineering department, sales group, 1st, 2nd, 3rd floor, and so on.
