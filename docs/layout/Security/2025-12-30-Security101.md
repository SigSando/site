## Foreword

For me, cybersecurity is an active part of my lifestyle as much as it can be an weird concept that an IT person is talking about. 

It always leads me to wonder - What should someone know before they are introduced to something?


We see this quite often in onboarding/offboarding for jobs. Regardless if this is your first job in high school serving food or if you are new security personnel at a large company - Usually both starting and leaving usually sucks.

- The point being made here is that the size/reputation/importance of the thing (like a large well-known company) does not dictate quality.

- In fact, most of the time we have pre-baked expectations for a large well-known company based on what we have learned throughout life. We would expect a large company to have top of the line security and funding and a small company to have poor security and terrible funding. Just based on the way the world goes. 



# Cybersecurity 101

Security should not be thought about soley in the context of defending companies. Cybersecurity is important for anyone to learn going through the world today.

I feel that many paople write cybersecurity off as something that needn't be worried about or exclusive to the tech savvy. 

As it exists today, most people's data who are in contact with the wider 1st world internet as constantly being surveiled and farmed for attention. 
So its up to you on whether or not to take cybersecurity seriously right?? No.

No no no.

## Security and Cyber security 
These are 2 very different things, Security and Cybersecurity. 

Security is usually some form of the degree of resistance from outside harm or protection of the state of being. 

Cybersecurity is the practice and art of security formulated towards networks, digital/electric systems and programs.

So we can clearly the SCOPE of Cyberesecurity is far smaller than security of a person.
