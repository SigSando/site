## Foreword

Cybersecurity is a part of everyones lives' nowadays regardless of whether we like it or not.

Awareness - It always leads me to wonder - What should someone know before they are introduced to something?

Obviously something like CYBERSECURITY/INFORMATION SECURITY/INFOSEC is quite an alarming and attention demanding of a title.

We see this quite the issue of  in onboarding/offboarding for jobs. Regardless if this is your first job in high school just serving food or if you are new to the IT team at a large company - Usually both proccesses of starting and leaving usually sucks. 

- The point being made here is that the size/reputation/importance of the thing (like a large well-known company) does not dictate quality or good.

- In fact, most of the time we have pre-baked expectations for a large well-known company based on what we have learned throughout life. We would expect a large company to have top of the line security and funding and a small company to have poor security and terrible funding. Just based on the way the world goes. 

Security should not be thought about soley in the context of defending companies. 

Cybersecurity is important for anyone to learn going through the world today. It's also easier to think of Cybersecurity as protecting everything on the network.

I feel that many people write cybersecurity off as something that needn't be worried about or exclusive to the tech savvy. 

When you think about security as a mindset, security from stress and axiety inducing situations - you begin to figure out how to navigate this icy world.

## Security and Cyber security for you
These are 2 very different things, Security and Cybersecurity. 


Security is usually some form of the degree of resistance from outside harm or protection of the state of being. (large scope) 

Cybersecurity is the practice and art of security formulated towards defending networks, digital/electric systems and programs. (smaller scope kinda)

## Cybersecurity basics

Let's start with networking. 
A simple example may be a small home office.

ISP service -> Firewall/Router & AP -> office computer, family phones, endpoints, servers, backends etc. 




## Though Exercises

It's far easier to start with what you are trying to defend.

EXAMPLE: 

Let's go over a few common question scenarios:

How do I make sure I'm safe?

How can I make sure my family such as my grandparents or parents aren't scammed or hacked?

How can I make sure I have privacy?
