## Foreword

Cybersecurity is a part of everyones lives' nowadays regardless of whether we like it or not.

Awareness - It always leads me to wonder - What should someone know before they are introduced to something?

Obviously something like CYBERSECURITY/INFORMATION SECURITY/INFOSEC is quite an alarming and attention demanding of a title.

We see this quite the issue of  in onboarding/offboarding for jobs. Regardless if this is your first job in high school just serving food or if you are new to the IT team at a large company - Usually both proccesses of starting and leaving usually sucks. 

- The point being made here is that the size/reputation/importance of the thing (like a large well-known company) does not dictate quality or good.

- In fact, most of the time we have pre-baked expectations for a large well-known company based on what we have learned throughout life. We would expect a large company to have top of the line security and funding and a small company to have poor security and terrible funding. Just based on the way the world goes. 

Security should not be thought about soley in the context of defending companies. 

Cybersecurity is important for anyone to learn going through the world today. It's also easier to think of Cybersecurity as protecting everything on the network.

I feel that many people write cybersecurity off as something that needn't be worried about or exclusive to the tech savvy. 

When you think about security as a mindset, security from stress and axiety inducing situations - you begin to figure out how to navigate this icy world.

## Security and Cyber security for you
These are 2 very different things, Security and Cybersecurity. 

Security is usually some form of the degree of resistance from outside harm or protection of the state of being. (large scope) 

Cybersecurity is the practice and adaptation of security formulated towards defending networks, digital/electric systems and programs. (smaller scope kinda)

## Cybersecurity basics

Let's start with networking. 
A simple example may be a small home office.

ISP service -> Firewall/Router & AP -> office computer, family phones, endpoints, servers, backends etc. 

Security is layered, reference OSI Model and the KEV CVSS vectors. ( known exploited vulnerabilities ) 

Each of the devices in the simple example may have security flaws. Lets proceed to the next sections with those seeds in mind.

## Thought Exercises

### This next section is a self-reflection exercise.

It's far easier to start visualize with what you are trying to do, when you value what you are to defend.



### EXAMPLE: 

Let's go over a few common question scenarios:

q1. How do I make sure I'm safe online?

q2. How can I make sure my family such as my grandparents or parents aren't scammed or hacked?

q3. How can I make sure I have privacy? 



1a. I think being safe on the internet requires preparation. Understanding what current threats are out there, and what threats your normal day-to-day doings proximate you closest to. In other real words - being safe requires understanding what level of threats you face. 
- Most of the time this can be and not limited to: Angry Ex, Scammers, "Hackers", Foriegn spyware, Nation states, APTs etc.
- Used to be in the early stages of the internet that people were only exposed to the first 3 (Angry Ex, Scammers, "Hackers".) However we live in 2025 with gestapo ICE hyper nazis. Foriegn spyware and Nation states also pose a consideration for being safe online.

2a. It's difficult not to have anyone click on phishing or be socially engineered. Informing them of the risks such as Generative AI used for extortion and impersonation attacks would be secondary only to telling them to reach out directly if anything out of the ordinary happens or its suspected GenAI extortion. 

3a. Privacy aint even really possible nowadays. With the way things are - you don't need internet to even participate in 1st world surveillance states. (state of being) 
- For the average individual just avoid posting your face and family on social media. If you know your followers great, but you should be auditing your followers and keeping acounts on private. 
- There isn't any inherent risk with posting to friend groups and whatnot.

Thanks.
