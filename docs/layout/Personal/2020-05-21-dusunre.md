### My favorite books are Dormia and The Alchemist,

I also like other stories.

Some stories I found:

One story is of Kinoingan and the sacrifice of Huminodun to feed and save humanity. It is a story that provides insight into the origins of "Kaamatan" or the Harvest festival. A telling of this story can be read on "[The Flying Dusun]"

Another is the origin place of all of the tribes in Borneo. Nunuk Ragang, a giant red Bayan fig tree was said to be the first shared Kadazan dusun home. Many versions of this origin story are told a simple version is captured on [MomogunTV]'s website

Lastly, the story of the Joker and the Dragon.
